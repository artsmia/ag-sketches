# African Gallery Sketches

Sketching out ideas for the reinstallation. Coming soon.

## Install

* `npm install` installs grunt and bower
* `npm install -g grunt-cli bower` installs the grunt and bower commands
* add /usr/local/share/npm/bin to $PATH
* `bower install` takes care of the JS dependencies
* `grunt server` fires it up
